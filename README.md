# Tensorflow playground

This repo originally started as a fork of Martin's Gorners excellent tutorial repo 
[Tensorflow and deep learning, without a PhD](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial), which quickly
became my sandbox for experimentation with new features of tensor flow as well as new concepts from deep learning.

Since some of my files were partial copies of Martin's files, where I have added new elements while following the tutorial, I 
kept the original repo in `originals` directory with all the files from there (I just updated few imports so everyting
was working as expected).
